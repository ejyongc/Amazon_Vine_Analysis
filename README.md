# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

# 1. Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
In this project we are analysing Amazon Vine Data reviews for Music to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members. 

# 2. Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions:
* How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?
After cleaning the data we have a total of *105,986* reviews. Which *105,979* are non-Vine (unpaid) and *7* Vine (paid) reviews.

* How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
There's a total of *67,580* non-Vine 5-star reviews while there are none 5-star Vine reviews. 

* What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
From the results above, we have calculated that 5-star reviews represent *63.77%* of all the non-Vine reviews while there's none 5-star Vine (paid) reviews. 

# 3. Summary: In your summary, state if there is any positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program. Use the results of your analysis to support your statement. Then, provide one additional analysis that you could do with the dataset to support your statement.

From ther results of the analysis we can conlude that there's not positive bias for reviews on the Vine program since there's actually no 5-star reviews coming from Vine.

In addition to the analysis above, we also wanted to see the distribution of all the other Vine and non-Vine review ratings. We can see that Vine (paid) services have received 3 and 4 star reviews but none 1 or 2 star reviews. On the other hand, when reviewing the non-Vine (unpaid) reviews, we can see a normal distribution across the 5 levels of ratings.
