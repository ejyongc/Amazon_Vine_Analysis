# 3. Summary

From ther results of the analysis we can conlude that there's not positive bias for reviews on the Vine program since there's actually no 5-star reviews coming from Vine. 

In addition to the analysis above, we also wanted to see the distribution of all the other Vine and non-Vine review ratings. We can see that Vine (paid) services have received 3 and 4 star reviews but none 1 or 2 star reviews. On the other hand, when reviewing the non-Vine (unpaid) reviews, we can see a normal distribution across the 5 levels of ratings.
